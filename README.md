# math-modeler
Creates a bootstrap slider fueled grapher for a specified list of graphs and functions

Made this to be a simple to distribute and run interactable presentation for the PEEC.
The research was done by other members of the class and aggregated together into the source.js

The page itself uses bootstrap, jQuery, and a slider plugin to create the front end.
The source.js will be read in and used to generate the controls, displays, and graphs.

If the source.js is invalid it just does an alert and you should check the JSON validity.
