# math-modeler
Creates a bootstrap slider fueled grapher for a specified list of graphs and functions

Made this to be a simple to distribute and run interactable presentation for [PEEC](https://www.peec.org/).
The research was done by other members of the class and aggregated together into the source.js

You can make different presentations or models for display by editing the source.js to reflect your own data and models. The description of your model that will be located at the top of the page is actually in the index.html file (it really should be in the source as well but I was not that concerned about that level is customizability).

The page itself uses bootstrap, jQuery, and a slider plugin to create the front end.
The source.js will be read in and used to generate the controls, displays, and graphs.

If the source.js is invalid it just does an alert and you should check the JSON validity.
